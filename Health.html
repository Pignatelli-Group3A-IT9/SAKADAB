                              <br>
                              <br>
                              D= The problem that the institution is facing is financial problems. As they have difficulty in maintaining a sustainable way in earning funds. This is concerning as the institution depends on the money that they get from selling their products in order to support the institution. 
                              Because of their lack of sales from their products, this causes them to not earn enough money to provide for their institution 
                              which leads to funding/financing problems within the institution. 
                              Our ideal situation for the institution are for them to be able to have a sustainable way of earning funds, 
                              without having to rely on anyone else. We would also like for them to be able to improve their business tactics such as their way of promoting their website and their own products.
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           E- What we want to achieve is that the SAKADAB' s product and the institution itself be recognized and known for their needs.
                            We also want to preserve this project ours by also let them use for their needs so they can use it for their future purposes. 
                           This way even if we are done on this project they can benefit from it and continue to preserve it which can help them to be self sufficient.
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           C-The possible choices/alternatives that meet the criteria is by promoting the institution and their products online such as doing posters/websites 
                           to help and better introduce the institution to the public so a majority of people are able to familiarize and get to know the institution. 
                           Another alternative is through starting programs that will get people to donate money to the institution in order for them to provide for the institutions needs such as getting enough funds to support for their community.
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           I-The best alternative is through promoting our partner institution. 
                           Promoting their institution helps bring people to get to know the institution and their needs, 
                           this helps them to understand the situation of the SAKADAB institution and will be able to help address their issue as well as helping them to get sales from their products in order for them to earn enough money for their institution.
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           D-The plan of action is going to be implemented through using social media to promote and show the products of the SAKADAB community. 
                           Resources that are needed are going to be good internet connection, wide social media platforms like facebook, instagram etc. 
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           E- The things that can go wrong with the project is that, the activities we do wouldn't be able to gather enough attention to provide enough 
                           attention to both the Institution and their products. Which would not only make our project deem unsucessful but would also 
                           stop our partnered institutiton to grow and reach their goal which is to become a self sustainable training center.
