                              <h3>Project Background</h3>
                              The problem that our proposed project aims to solve is the financial crisis that the institution is currently experiencing. Due to many factors, such as the pandemic, 
                              the institution has had a hard time finding and maintaining sustainable financing. Which brings us to our proposed project, which aims to solve the problem by finding a sustainable solution that will help the institution long after the project has dissipated. 
                              This problem is important to solve as their constitution heavily relies on it. After all, without an adequate way of sustaining funds, the institution would have difficulty paying for their utilities and hired help, gathering materials to do their projects, and lastly, experiencing severe trouble providing for their basic needs. This proposed project will help in solving the institutional problem by not only helping their institution and products be advertised more, 
                              which can lead to donations and people buying their products, but can also help the institution by people helping out their institution more, lthrough volunteer work, 
                              business contacts for the gathering of materials for their projects, etc., all caused by the exposure that was brought to the institution, which was provided by the project.

                              Our project aims to help the SAKADAB institution maintain a good sustainable way in earning funds, 
                              to improve their marketing strategies for them to get more sales from their products and to improve their popularity to the public,
                               this helps them to get exposure and be well known by a majority of people who are willing to help.

			  <br>
           <h3>Problem Present</h3>
           Despite their support from one another,
            they still face issues such as financial problems as they have difficulty in maintaining a sustainable way in earning funds to support their institution.
             Since they depend on the money that they get from selling their handicrafts or products to support their institution and because of the lack of sales from their products, 
             this might negatively affect them and the institution.

                                 The intervention that we intend to propose, to address the problem discussed,
                                  is too advertise and popularize the institution and its products with any means.
                                   Helping them create a better social media presence through various activities, 
                                   accounts dedicated to them and improving their business practices. 
                                   This project will solve the problems the institution are facing as it will help popularize their institution, which will increase the sales of their products and receive funding from donations. 
                                   This project is appropriate and manageable by the institution as it doesn’t require that much funds in maintaining and wouldn’t require too many people in maintaining the accounts that would be dedicated to them.
                                    This project is appropriate to its cause and needs as well as they require the advertisement to their institution and the promotion of their products to increase their source of income to be more self sustainable. 
                                    Our project  aims to have a long term effect on the institution guaranteeing it’s sustainable source of income as for them to be able to continue on even after our project has dissipated as for them to contine on accomplishing their goals and activities.
